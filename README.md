# Test Your Tech

## Inspiration
Nobody likes typing code out for test cases. Code gets repetitive and boring.

## What it does
It provides an interactive visual interface to create and maintain test cases for your web application.

## How we built it
Python Django and Selenium for backend, and HTML/CSS/jQuery for frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
The integration between frontend and backend, as they were coded by different people.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept.

## What we learned


## What's next for Test your Tech
Deploy it to a large scale running web application, and fully replace the need to typing out repetitive code for QA analysts.
